Description: ATAC-seq, an assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin
    using sequencing, is a rapid and sensitive method for chromatin
    accessibility analysis. Compared to other methods, such as 
    MNase-seq, FAIRE-seq and DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq requires less 
    biological materials and time to process. In this workshop, 
    participants will not only gain the theoretical understanding of
    the characteristics of ATAC-seq data and the workflow of ATAC-seq
    data quality assessment, but will also obtain hands-on experience
    in analyzing ATAC-seq data using the ATACseqQC package. We will
    provide a brief introduction to the ATAC-seq technology, high
    quality data generation and computational analysis workflow. Then, 
    we will give a demo to perform a comprehensive quality assessment
    of a typical ATAC-seq dataset using the ATACseqQC package. Participants 
    will have the opportunity to analyze several excerpted datasets of 
    different quality. Detailed notes and R code will be provided for
    reproducibility and follow-up practicing.
