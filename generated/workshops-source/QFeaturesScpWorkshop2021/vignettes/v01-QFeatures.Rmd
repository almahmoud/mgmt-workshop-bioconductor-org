# Introduction

`QFeatures` is a package for the manipulation of mass spectrometry 
(MS)-based quantitative proteomics data. The quantitative data is 
generally obtained after running a preprocessing algorithm on raw MS 
profiles called spectra. The algorithm attempts to match each spectra 
to a peptide database to infer the peptide sequence. A spectrum
for which a corresponding peptide could be found is called peptide to
spectrum match (PSM). The intensities recorded by the MS are then 
used to quantify the PSMs. The quantified PSMs are used as input by 
`QFeatures` and undergo various data wrangling steps to reconstruct
the peptide data and then the protein data, usually of interest for 
elucidating the biological question at hand. 

MS-based quantification data can be represented as a matrix of 
quantitative values for features (PSMs, peptides, proteins) arranged 
along the rows, measured for a set of samples, arranged along the 
columns. The matrix format is a common representation for any 
quantitative data set. We will be using the `SummarizedExperiment` 
[@SE] class:

```{r sefig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the anatomy of a `SummarizedExperiment` object. (Figure taken from the `SummarizedExperiment` package vignette.)", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/SE.png")
```

- The sample (columns) metadata can be access with the `colData()`
  function.
- The features (rows) metadata can be access with the `rowData()`
  column.
- The quantiative data can be accessed with `assay()`.
- `assays()` returns a list of matrix-like assays.

Note that other classes that inherits from `SummarizedExperiment` can 
also be used. We will see in the other vignette that for single-cell
proteomics data, we will use `SingleCellExperiment` objects. 

# QFeatures

While mass spectrometers acquire data for spectra/peptides, the
biological entity of interest are the protein. As part of the data
processing, we are thus required to **aggregate** low-level
quantitative features into higher level data.

```{r featuresplot, fig.cap = "Conceptual representation of a `QFeatures` object and the aggregative relation between different assays.", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 20),
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "", bty = "n")

for (i in 0:7)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 8:12)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 13:18)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 19)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 5:7)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")

for (i in 8:10)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 11:13)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 14)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

rect(9, 8, 12, 8+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")
rect(9, 9, 12, 9+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")
rect(9, 10, 12, 10+1, col = "orange", border = "white")
rect(9, 11, 12, 11+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

segments(3, 8, 5, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 6, 5, 7, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 4, 5, 6, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 0, 5, 5, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 10, 5, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 11, 5, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 13, 5, 11, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 14, 5, 12, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 16, 5, 13, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 19, 5, 14, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 20, 5, 15, lty = "dashed")


segments(8, 5, 9, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 8, 9, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 11, 9, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 14, 9, 11, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 15, 9, 12, lty = "dashed")
```

We are going to start to familiarise ourselves with the `QFeatures`
class implemented in the
[`QFeatures`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
package. The class is derived from the Bioconductor
`MultiAssayExperiment` [@MAE] class. Let's start by loading the
`QFeatures` package.

```{r pkgs, message = FALSE}
library("QFeatures")
```

Next, we load the `feat1` test data, which is composed of single
*assay* of class `SummarizedExperiment` composed of 10 rows and 2
columns.

```{r load_feat1}
data(feat1)
feat1
```

Let's perform some simple operations to familiarise ourselves with the
`QFeatures` class:

- Extract the sample metadata using the `colData()` accessor (like you
  have previously done with `SummarizedExperiment` objects).

```{r cd}
colData(feat1)
```

- Extract the first (and only) assay composing this `QFeaures` data
  using the `[[` operator (as you have done to extract elements of a
  list) by using the assay's index or name.

```{r assay1}
feat1[[1]]
feat1[["psms"]]
```

- Extract the `psms` assay's row data and quantitative values.

```{r rd}
assay(feat1[[1]])
rowData(feat1[[1]])
```

# Feature aggregation


The central functionality of the `QFeatures` infrastructure is the
aggregation of features into higher-level features while retaining the
link between the different levels. This can be done with the
[`aggregateFeatures()` function](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-aggregate.html).

The call below will

- operate on the `psms` assay of the `feat1` objects;
- aggregate the rows the assay following the grouping defined in the
  `peptides` row data variables;
- perform aggregation using the `colMeans()` function;
- create a new assay named `peptides` and add it to the `feat1`
  object.

```{r agg1}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "psms",
                           fcol = "Sequence",
                           name = "peptides",
                           fun = colMeans)
feat1
```

**Note**: we do not claim that `colMeans` is the best aggregation 
method. There are other more robust methods for aggregating features, 
for instance `MsCoreUtils::robustSummary` is a good alternative. See 
the documentation of `aggregateFeatures` for more information. 

**Exercise at home**: check that you understand the effect of feature
aggregation and repeat the calculations manually. Compare your manual 
results agains the content of the new assay's row data.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r cm}
## Data before aggregation
data.frame(assay(feat1[["psms"]]), 
           Sequence = rowData(feat1[["psms"]])$Sequence)

## SYGFNAAR
colMeans(assay(feat1[["psms"]])[1:3, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["SYGFNAAR", ]

## ELGNDAYK
colMeans(assay(feat1[["psms"]])[4:6, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["ELGNDAYK", ]

## IAEESNFPFIK
colMeans(assay(feat1[["psms"]])[7:10, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["IAEESNFPFIK", ]
```
</details>

```{r rd2}
rowData(feat1[[2]])
```

We can now aggregate the peptide-level data into a new protein-level
assay using the `colMedians()` aggregation function.

```{r agg2}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "peptides",
                           fcol = "Protein",
                           name = "proteins",
                           fun = colMedians)
feat1
assay(feat1[["proteins"]])
```

You can also get a graphical overview of the QFeatures object thanks to
the `plot` function. Arrows represent the links between the assays. 

```{r plot, out.height="300px", out.width="300px"}
plot(feat1)
```

# Subsetting and filtering

The subsetting a `QFeatures` object can be performed using the 3-index
subset operator, `[`. The first index will subset the features of 
interest. If the feature is linked to features from other assays, those
features will also 

```{r QFeatures_subsetting, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Conceptual illustration of the 3-index subsetting of `QFeatures` object.",  out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/QFeatures_subsetting.png")
```

We provide an example of subsetting features that are associated to 
features from other assays. When we subset for protein A as shown 
below or using the `subsetByFeature()` function, this creates a new
instance of class `QFeatures` containing assays with the expression 
data for protein, its peptides and their PSMs.

```{r prota}
feat1["ProtA", , ]
```

The `filterFeatures()` function can be used to filter rows the assays
composing a `QFeatures` object using the row data variables. We can
for example retain rows that have a `pval` < 0.05, which would only
keep rows in the `psms` assay because the `pval` is only relevant for
that assay.

```{r ff1}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ pval < 0.05)
```

On the other hand, if we filter assay rows for those that localise to
the mitochondrion, we retain the relevant protein, peptides and PSMs.

```{r ff2}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location == "Mitochondrion")
```

As an exercise, let's filter rows that do not localise to the
mitochondrion.

```{r ff3}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location != "Mitochondrion")
```

Another useful filtering functionality is `filterNA` that removes 
features based on the amount of missing data it contains. To 
illustrate this, we will load a data set containing missing data

```{r missing}
data("ft_na")
ft_na
assay(ft_na[[1]])
```

We can remove feature that contain more that a given percentage 
missing values. For instance, let's remove features with more than 25
\% missing data. We expect to keep only 1 features as all the other
features contain 33 \% missing values. 

```{r filterNA}
filterNA(ft_na, i = "na", pNA = 0.25)
```

The resulting `QFeatures` object contains a single feature as we
expected. 

# Data processing

The `Qfeatures` package provides a few utility functions to process 
the data: 

- Logarithmic transform: `logTransform` creates a new assay in a 
  `QFeatures` object that contains the log-transformed quantification
  of the target assay. 
  
```{r logTransform}
logTransform(feat1, i = "proteins", base = 2, name = "logproteins")
```

- Normalization: `normalize` creates a new assay in a 
  `QFeatures` object that contains the normalized quantification
  of the target assay. See the `?QFeatures::normalize` documentation 
  for a list of available normalization methods. If the method you are
  looking for is not available, you could also consider 
  `QFeatures::sweep`. 

```{r}
normalize(feat1, i = "proteins", method = "center.median", name = "normproteins")
```

- Imputation: `imputes` predicts missing values in a new assay. See
  the `?MsCoreUtils::impute_matrix()` for a list of available 
  imputation methods. In this example, we impute missing values with 
  zero. 

```{r}
assay(ft_na[[1]])
ft_na <- impute(ft_na, i = 1, method = "zero")
assay(ft_na[[1]])
```
