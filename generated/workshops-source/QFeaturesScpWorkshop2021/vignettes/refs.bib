              widely available performance standard of biological complexity
              (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform
              performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across
              different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations
              of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used
              extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to
              characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is
              uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the
              most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and
              the only one associated with several large scale studies
              estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this
              study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale
              production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots
              to the community through the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology where the yeast proteome is under development as a
              certified reference material to meet the long term needs of the

              performance, we provide a reference data set demonstrating
              typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument
              platforms in expert laboratories; the results provide a basis for
              laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon
              current methods, and to evaluate new technologies. Additionally,
              we demonstrate how the yeast reference, spiked with human
              proteins, can be used to benchmark the power of proteomics
              platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at
              different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby

                  workflows for differential expression (DE) analysis
                  of proteins impose important challenges on the data
                  analysis due to peptide-specific effects and context
                  dependent missingness of peptide
                  intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob,
                  test for DE directly from peptide intensities and
                  outper-form summarization methods which first
                  aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein
                  intensities before DE analysis. However, these
                  methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
                  understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do
                  not provide protein summaries, which are important
                  for visualisation or downstream processing. In this
                  work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art
                  summarization strategies using a benchmark spike-in
                  dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared
                  to the state-of-the-art peptide based model,
                  MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel
                  summarization strategy, MSqRob-Sum, which estimates
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s model parameters in a
                  two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of
                  peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s superior performance, while
                  providing useful protein expression summaries for
                  plotting and downstream analysis. Summarising
                  peptide to protein intensities considerably reduces
                  the computational complexity, the memory footprint
                  and the model complexity, and makes it easier to
                  disseminate DE inferred on protein
                  summaries. Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly
                  modular analysis framework, which provides
                  researchers with full flexibility to develop data
                  analysis workflows tailored towards their specific

  abstract = "MS-based proteome profiling has become increasingly comprehensive
              and quantitative, yet a persistent shortcoming has been the
              relatively large samples required to achieve an in-depth

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Macrophages are innate immune cells with diverse
              functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely
              unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of the
              limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis.
              RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, we develop SCoPE2, which
              substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput
              while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated
              and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to
              analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous
              monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence
              of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantifies over 3042 proteins in
              1490 single monocytes and macrophages in 10 days of instrument
              time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single
              cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous
              gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing
              cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10$\times$
              Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more
              protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus, SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. This
              allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as interactions
              between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the
              transcripts of genes regulated by p53. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a
              homogeneous environment, macrophage proteomes are heterogeneous.
              This heterogeneity correlates to the inflammatory axis of
              classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Our
              methodology lays the foundation for automated and quantitative
              single-cell analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry and
              demonstrates the potential for inferring transcriptional and
              post-transcriptional regulation from variability across single

              actively embracing quantitative, single cell-level analyses.
              Indeed, recent advances in sample preparation and mass
              spectrometry (MS) have enabled the emergence of quantitative
              MS-based single-cell proteomics (SCP). While exciting and
              promising, SCP still has many rough edges. The current analysis
              workflows are custom and build from scratch. The field is
              therefore craving for standardized software that promotes
              principled and reproducible SCP data analyses.Areas covered This
              special report represents the first step toward the formalization
              of standard SCP data analysis. Scp, the software that accompanies
              this work can successfully reproduces one of the landmark data in
              the field of SCP. We created a repository containing the
              reproduction workflow with comprehensive documentation in order
              to favor further dissemination and improvement of SCP data
              analyses.Expert opinion Reproducing SCP data analyses uncovers
              important challenges in SCP data analysis. We describe two such
              challenges in detail: batch correction and data missingness. We
              provide the current state-of-the-art and illustrate the
              associated limitations. We also highlights the intimate
              dependence that exists between batch effects and data missingness

              (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in
              microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of
              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global
              retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates
              towards improved confidence estimates of
              peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell
              samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30-50\%
              at 1\% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate
              excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and
              support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as
              identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The

  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We

              practice. Software for our method is freely available at:
