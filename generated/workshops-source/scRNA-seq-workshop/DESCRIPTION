Description:
    In this workshop (presented in Mandarin), you will learn how to analyse 
    single-cell RNA-sequencing count data produced by the Chromium 10x platform 
    using R/Bioconductor. This will include reading the data into R, 
    pre-processing data, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality 
    reduction and downstream analysis, such as clustering and cell type 
    annotation. You will learn how to generate common plots for analysis and 
    visualisation of single cell gene expfression data, such as diagnostic 
    plots to assess the data quality as well as dimensionality reduction 
    techniques such as principal components analysis and t-distributed 
    stochastic neighbourhood embedding (t-SNE). The material we will be 
    covering on single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis is a subset of the work 
    of Amerzquita et al. (2020) Nature Methods,17:137–145 available at 
    https://osca.bioconductor.org. The course is aimed at PhD students,
    Master’s students, and third & fourth year undergraduate students.
